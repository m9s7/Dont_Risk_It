# Don't RISK It flutter app
An app made in flutter for calculating your chances of winning a battle in a game of RiSiKo!

1. Enter the number of tanks you have on a field.
2. Enter the number of tanks you would prefer to have left on the field after the battle.
3. Enter the number of enemies tanks.

And then think again if it's a smart move to attack, because risiko is a game of defence, strategy and diplomacy. Just like in nature agression between two parties leaves them hurt, vulnerable and exposed to third party attacks. So you better make sure you dominate your battles and suffer minimal losses and for that **you'll need probability on your side**.
